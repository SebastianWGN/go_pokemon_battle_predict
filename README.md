# Pokemon Battle Predict

System prediction of pokemon battles based on Logistic Regression with concurrency in go

## Starting 🚀

For this project we need to install the libraries **gota/dataframe** and **gonum/mat** for handling matrices and reading csv files.

```
go get github.com/kniren/gota/dataframe
```

```
go get "gonum.org/v1/gonum/mat"
```

### Execute 🔧

Being a simple project in Go language, it will only be necessary to execute the run command

```
go run LRM_pokemon.go
```
