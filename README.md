System prediction of pokemon battles based on Logistic Regression with concurrency in go

## Starting 🚀

```
go get github.com/kniren/gota/dataframe

```
go get "gonum.org/v1/gonum/mat"
```

### Execute 🔧

Being a simple project in Go language, it will only be necessary to execute the run command

```
go run LRM_pokemon.go
```
